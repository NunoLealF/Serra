/* void __attribute__((noreturn)) Init()

   Inputs:    (none)
   Outputs:   (none)

   Initializes the segment registers (in this case, DS, ES, FS, GS, and SS) with the data selector
   (10h) as set in our GDT, sets the stack location to 20000h (where it'll have 64KiB of space),
   and then jumps to our Bootloader() function.

   This function is defined by our linker to be at 7E00h in memory, which is where our first-stage
   bootloader (our MBR) jumps to after loading our second-stage bootloader into memory and enabling
   protected mode.

   As this is essentially the first code we execute after enabling protected mode, we need to set
   up a basic environment for our code - specifically, we need to set up the segment registers
   (except for CS), and set up a basic stack, which in our case is at 20000h.

void __attribute__((noreturn)) Init(void) {

  // Set up registers (DS, ES, FS, GS, and SS)
  // We'll be setting these up with the data segment (10h in our GDT).

  __asm__("mov $0x10, %eax;"
          "mov %eax, %ds;"
          "mov %eax, %es;"
          "mov %eax, %fs;"
          "mov %eax, %gs;"
          "mov %eax, %ss");

  // Set up the stack at 20000h (by setting SP).

  __asm__("mov $0x20000, %esp");

  // Jump to our Bootloader() function.

  Bootloader();

}


/* void __attribute__((noreturn)) Bootloader()

   Inputs:    (none)
   Outputs:   (none)

   This is our second-stage bootloader's main function. We jump here after Init().

   Todo: Write a more concise description. (I feel like this is only really possible after actually
   finishing this part, lol)
